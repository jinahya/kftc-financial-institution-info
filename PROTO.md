# PROTOBUF

This module, for the `proto` profile, uses the _build.gradle to compile proto files into java sources.

It works for now.

Check the _build.gradle and maven-exec-plugin's configuration.

Find optimal configuration.

Do not change other parts in the pom.xml

You can change gradle related files.
